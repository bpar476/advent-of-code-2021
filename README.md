# Advent of Code 2021

This repo is a [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) app so each day can be run as a command. The only required flag is the global `--input-file` flag. Input files are stored in the inputs directory.

`go build .`
`./advent-of-code-2021 --input-file inputs/day1-example.txt day1`
